Prediction-of-Associations-Between-CircRNA-and-Disease

Here are the data and code we used for the project of predicting disease-associated circRNAs.

(1) The python files(*.py) are source code for each method, while the bash shell files(*.sh) are scripts we used to run for the results;

(2) The 'input-15' directory contains the topological features we extracted for the 15 diseases we analyzed: 
      the first 24 columns are features, while the last column is label(positive: 1 or unlabeled: 0).
      
(3) The other 8 directories contains output result for each method respectively.

We appreciate your interest in our paper, and would like to help if you have any questions.
Thanks~ :)
